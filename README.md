## An Analysis of UFO sightings
  Our client, Dana, needs to create an interactive website so that visitors can search for UFO sightings by certain criteria. She has recently discovered that by incorporating Javescript into her HTML she will be able to filter her data from user input. She is very excited to begin this adventure
### Tools and ToDos
  * build a table using a javascript array
  * create filters to make this table fully dynamic
  * cusomize the webpage with bootstrap, css, and html
## Results

Dana was very happy to see her vision come to fruition. From her chosen image to the displayed data she wanted to parse through, everything was perfect. She was thrilled to see that all the search functions she wanted to add were also there. But did they work?

And work they do!
The five search boxes can be used by following the sample format already in each input field. You can search from 1 to 5 criteria. Whenever you hit enter or click on a new input box the table filters by your selections as seen in the exmaple of "circle" in the shape input field.
## Summary
### Drawback
  * The user must use the exact same case as the table for each input field. The entire table is in lower case and the user may not realize that.
  * There is not an entry for each date or a listed date range to search through.
### Recommendations
  * For this particular project using the .toLowerCase() might solve the problem of user input to match the data they are searching through.
  * In the shape field I would add a drop down box to choose which shape you would like to search for instead of having the user input the search criteria.
  * Add a date range for the user to choose between
